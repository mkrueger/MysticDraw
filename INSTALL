Guided Installation:
--------------------

REQUIREMENTS

- SDL
- A C++ Compiler

INSTALLATION
- type 'make' in the src/ directory

 > !IMPORTANT! <

- create an ~/.mdraw path (this is in your home directory)
- copy mdraw.config to ~/.mdraw
- copy allfont.fnt to ~/.mdraw
- copy font.fnt to ~/.mdraw
  (you can use any 8x16 console font)

Note: on non unix systems you have to set the environment variable HOME to a directory
which holds the .mdraw folder.
  
Now you can type "mdraw" and start the program. You can copy mdraw to
any binary directory it only needs the files in the ~/.mdraw directory
to function properly.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If you install MysticDraw 1.6 over an 1.4 version get sure that you use
  the NEW font file (allfont.fnt). I needed to change the file format a bit.
